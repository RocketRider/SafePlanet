# SafePlanet
A simple but secure passwordsafe

# Info
Always make sure you have a backup of your *.safeplanet and the SecureKey. You can export the SecureKey in the tool and protect it with any password you like.(No password is supported but not recomended)

To change the key length of the SecureKey set the value "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\SafePlanet\SecKeyLength" to the value you would like. The default value is 32.
This only works while creating a new database, after that this setting will be ignored.
